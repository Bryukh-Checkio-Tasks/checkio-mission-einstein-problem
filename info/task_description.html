    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle#cite_note-1">The Einstein's Puzzle</a>
    is a well-known logic puzzle.
    It is often called Einstein's Puzzle because it is said to have been invented by Albert Einstein as a boy.
    However, there is no known evidence for Einstein's or Carroll's authorship.
    This puzzle can be modified with various conditions and we will get many similar puzzle.
    For start we will solve simplifier version of the puzzle.

<p>
    There are 5 houses (along the street) in 5 different colors:
    <b>blue</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>white</b> and <b>yellow</b>.<br>
    In each house lives a person of a different nationality:
    <b>Brit</b>, <b>Dane</b>, <b>German</b>, <b>Norwegian</b> and <b>Swede</b>.<br>
    These people drink a certain beverage:
    <b>beer</b>, <b>coffee</b>, <b>milk</b>, <b>tea</b> and <b>water</b>.
    Smoke a certain brand of cigarettes:
    <b>Rothmans</b>, <b>Dunhill</b>, <b>PallMall</b>, <b>Winfield</b> and <b>Marlboro</b>.<br>
    Keep a certain pet:
    <b>cat</b>, <b>bird</b>, <b>dog</b>, <b>fish</b> and <b>horse</b>.
</p>

<p>
    No owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the same beverage.
</p>

<p>
    You are given a set of "relations". Each relation connect two term in ownership relation. For example:
    "Norwegian-Dunhill" means that Norwegian smoke only Dunhill, or "5-dog" means that owner of 5th house keeps a dog.
    In this Einstein's problem version we will use only these relations.
</p>

<p>
    The second argument is a question which you should answer. The question is represented as two words separated by dash.
    First word is characteristic of owner and the second is what you should say:
    <b>number</b>, <b>color</b>, <b>nationality</b>, <b>beverage</b>, <b>cigarettes</b> or <b>pet</b>.
    For example: "horse-cigarettes" is equal to question "What the cigarettes does smoke the owner of a horse?" or
    "green-number" == "What is the number of the green house?".
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Relations as a tuple of strings and a question as a string.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The answer as a string.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    As first it's of course you will be closer to solve the Einstein problem.
    And as side effect learn something about constraint satisfaction problems.

    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
